# Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Experiments

These two .pdf files include the results of my NMF experiment. I have obtained movie frames from an open-source movie. After expressing each of these frames as matrices Amat, I tried to factorize them i.e Amat = XY. You can see the predicted images in the file (XY).
